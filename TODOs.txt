fix the processref editor part of the process call

maybe make the SYNC part of the model def more optional

check if there are restrictions on what can be inside Id

look into the basic type rule for behaviour expressions

handle layout for exeedingly long behaviour expressions better

look into adding support for spreading code over multiple files

channel decl with no type?

type checks for channel defs.

split type into type definitions and type references

make channels refer to their definition.

channel id 

make sure names are unique for: main definitions(modeldef,chandef,etc) and channel definitions

add support of lists of identifiers in constructor fiels? I.E. a,b :: Int instead of a :: Int; b:: Int

design notes.
sequence cannot be standard binary expression, as those are all assumed to be left associative.
There does not seem to be a way to override this behaviour

modeldef vars have their own scope each. Each modeldef can have one var named 'x', etc

add chanel name checks in modeldef
