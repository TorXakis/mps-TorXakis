fix the processref editor part of the process call

maybe make the SYNC part of the model def more optional

check if there are restrictions on what can be inside Id

look into the basic type rule for behaviour expressions

handle layout for exeedingly long behaviour expressions better

look into adding support for spreading code over multiple files


design notes.
sequence cannot be standard binary expression, as those are all assumed to be left associative.
There does not seem to be a way to override this behaviour
